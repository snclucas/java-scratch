When to use CyclicBarrier in Java
Given the nature of CyclicBarrier it can be very handy to implement map reduce kind of task similar to fork-join
framework of Java 7, where a big task is broker down into smaller pieces and to complete the task you need output
from individual small task e.g. to count population of India you can have 4 threads which count population from North,
South, East, and West and once complete they can wait for each other, When last thread completed their task, Main
thread or any other thread can add result from each zone and print total population. You can use CyclicBarrier in Java :

1) To implement multi player game which can not begin until all player has joined.
2) Perform lengthy calculation by breaking it into smaller individual tasks,
In general, to implement Map reduce technique.

Important point of CyclicBarrier in Java
1. CyclicBarrier can perform a completion task once all thread reaches to the barrier,
This can be provided while creating CyclicBarrier.

2. If CyclicBarrier is initialized with 3 parties means 3 thread needs to call await method to break the barrier.
3. The thread will block on await() until all parties reach to the barrier, another thread interrupt or await timed out.
4. If another thread interrupts the thread which is waiting on barrier it will throw BrokernBarrierException as shown below:

java.util.concurrent.BrokenBarrierException
        at java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier.dowait(CyclicBarrier.java:172)
        at java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier.await(CyclicBarrier.java:327)

5.CyclicBarrier.reset() put Barrier on its initial state, other thread which is waiting or not yet
reached barrier will terminate with java.util.concurrent.BrokenBarrierException.

That's all on  What is CyclicBarrier in Java When to use CyclicBarrier in Java and a Simple
Example of How to use CyclicBarrier in Java . We have also seen the difference between
CountDownLatch and CyclicBarrier in Java and got some idea where we can use CyclicBarrier in Java Concurrent code.
